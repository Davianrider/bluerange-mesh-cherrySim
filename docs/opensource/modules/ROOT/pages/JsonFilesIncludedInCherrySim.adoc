= CherrySim Json File

== General
CherrySim uses several json files for configuration and debugging purposes. It depends on the command line arguments and the contents of the files, which of them are used.
* meshGwCommunication
* devices
* site
* replaylog


[#meshGwCommunication]
=== meshGwCommunication
This file includes all the cherrysim configurations e.g. number of nodes, number of assets, featureset etc. By default cherrsim only uses this file if the `MeshGwCommunication` argument is passed to `cherrySim_runner`. Below is an example meshGwCommunication.json file.

Most of the fields are self explanatory but some noteworthy fields are 

* `importFromJson` can be set to true if  xref:#devices[device] and  xref:#sites[sites] configuration needs to be extracted from devices.json and sites.json files. 
** There file locations can be provided in the properties `devicesJsonPath` and `siteJsonPath` in this file. 
* One can also set `verbose` to true in order to enable cherrysim logs.
* Field 'verboseCommands' is deprecated and only retained for compatibility reasons.
* `realTime` if set to true, the simulator will only tick when the real time clock passed the necessary time otherwise as fast as possible.  It can be a bit of a pitfall if you want to test something with a long replay log.
* `enableClusteringValidityCheck`, enable automatic checking of the clustering after each step. It is a heuristic and can have false positives as well, so that needs to be verified.
* `simTickDurationMs` simulation time per tick. It should not be changed unless one is really sure what he is doing.
* `nodeConfigName` is a key pair value in a map (map<std::string, int>) where key defines the featureset and value defines number of nodes with that featureset e.g
{"prod_sink_nrf52":1,"prod_mesh_nrf52":7} will have one node with prod_sink_nrf52 featureset and 7 nodes with prod_mesh_nrf52 featureset. In case we have `importFromJson` field set to true, these values will be ignored and the input will be directly taken from xref:#devices[device].
* `interruptProbability` is the probability with which a queued interrupt is simulated. if it has a value 0 means that interrupt wont be simulated.
* `preDefinedPositions` is the defined position in the space where beacon will be simulated. By default, if its not provided, the position will be defined randomly.
* 'simOtherDelay' is deprecated and retained only for compatibility reasons.
*  'playDelay' allows us to view the simulation slower than simulated, delay is added after each step.
* `mapElevationInMeters` is the elevations in the area depicted on a map.
* `floorBiasInMeters` defines the base height of floor number zero, it is subtracted from the `z` coordinate of a node before it's floor number is computed
* `ceilingHeightInMeters` defines the height of a floor for the purpose of the computation of the floor number (used to determine if a simulated signal has to penetrate one or more ceilings)
* `ceilingAttenuationDb` defines how the simulated signal strength is attenuated between nodes with different floor numbers (i.e. nodes where the signal would penetrate one or more ceilings)
* `simulateAdvertisingIndexStep` defines the fraction of nodes considered for advertisement delivery in each simulation step.
  It is not required to be changed from it's default value of 1 (all nodes) under normal circumstances.
  The parameter was introduced to make real-time simulations with many nodes feasible (hundreds, depends on the hardware).
  See the xref:CherrySim.adoc#ImplementationRSSI[simulator documentation] for some more information.

NOTE:  Adding and removing fields in the file wont work out the box, cherrysim code needs to be adjusted accordingly.

[#devices]
=== devices
This json file includes the configuration of each node i.e. deviceId, platform etc. Below is one of the example device.json file.

  			"deviceId": "ZZZZZ",

  			}
  		}
  	]
  }

Some of the fields that should be noted is that

* `deviceId` field assigns serialId to the node and is recommended to be provided if device json files is to be used. In case, the field is not present a default serialId will be assigned but that is not a recommended practice.

* `platform` field can have `BLENODE`, `ASSET` and `EDGEROUTER` depending on the type of platform one need and this field is mandatory.

* In the properties, the mandatory fields that must be present are the `x`, `y` and `onMap` must be true. While others will get default values if not present i.e 
** `zNorm`: `0`,  
** `cherrySimFeatureSet` if not present will get 
*** `cherrySimFeatureSet`: `prod_mesh_nrf52` in case of `platform`: `BLENODE`.
*** `cherrySimFeatureSet`: `prod_sink_nrf52` in case of `platform`: `EDGEROUTER`.
*** `cherrySimFeatureSet`: `prod_asset_nrf52` in case of `platform`: `ASSET`.
** `IOT_NODE_KEY`, `IOT_NETWORK_KEY`, `IOT_ORGANIZATION_KEY`, `IOT_NODE_ID` and `IOT_NETWORK_ID` will also get default values if not present.

[#sites]
=== sites
This file configures the site where all nodes would be present. Below is one of the example of site.json file.
[source,json]

{
	"results": [
		{
			"lengthInMeter": 100.0,
			"heightInMeter": 57,

			"pixelPerMeter": 24.57,
			"elevationInMeter": 60
		}
	]
}

=== replaylog

CherrySim is deterministic and reproducible and therefore it is possible to reply a log file which can be used for diagnostics purposes. To enable this feature the CherrySim that produced the log file should have been ran with `logReplayCommands = true`, this could have been set from xref:#meshGwCommunication[meshGwCommunication] in case cherrysim was configured to extract configuration from xref:#meshGwCommunication[meshGwCommunication] or if xref:#meshGwCommunication[meshGwCommunication] is not used, then it should be set to true in cherrysim implementation. The path of the log file can be set in the configuration field `replayPath` either in xref:#meshGwCommunication[meshGwCommunication] or in the cherrysim implementation. A designated line was created to help you with this, look for the String "@ReplayFeature@" inside `CherrySimRunner.cpp` for more information

NOTE: This feature should be used in CherrySimRunner configuration unless for some known purposes.

== Generate device JSON files

If you need many devices inside a network, you can generate the `devices_config.json` and `enrollments.json` for an arbitrary amount of nodes.

This is done by a Python script that can be found in `fruitymesh/cherrysim/runnerconfigs/generated/generate_configs.py`. Execute the script from within the `generated` directory to get additional help.
