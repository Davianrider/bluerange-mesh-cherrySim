= Scanning Module (ID 2)

== Purpose
The _ScanningModule_ with _ModuleId_ 2 does not contain any usable functionality at the moment. It is intended to be configurable with a number of filters to report a variety of advertisement messages over the mesh but is very much work in progress.

TIP: The _ScanningModule_ is not intended for receiving custom advertising messages. Implement the _BleEventHandler_ in your custom module to process the messages yourself. See xref:Modules.adoc[Modules] and xref:ScanController.adoc[ScanController] documentation.
