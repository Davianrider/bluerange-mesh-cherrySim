= Status Reporter Module (ID 3)

== Purpose
The _StatusReporterModule_ with _ModuleId_ 3 reports the node status in a configured interval. It provides methods for directly requesting different kinds of device info and status data.

== Functionality
The _StatusReporterModule_ can periodically send out
different kinds of informational messages. It also feeds the watchdog
when keep alive messages are received. It is responsible for sending out
logged error codes and measuring the necessary data for its messages
such as the battery power.

== Terminal Commands
=== Device Information
Generic information about a node that never changes or only changes through enrollment or firmware updates can be requested via the _get_device_info_ command.

[source,C++]
----
//Request the full device info from some nodes
action [nodeId] status get_device_info
----

=== Status Information
Information that is bound to change from time to time can be requested using the _get_status_ command.

[source,C++]
----
//Request the status
action [nodeId] status get_status
----

[#ConnectionInformation]
=== Connection Information
Information about the mesh connections of a node can be requested with the _get_connections_ or _get_nearby_ commands.

[source,C++]
----
//Retrieve the connections from all nodes in the network
action [nodeId] status get_connections
----

[source,C++]
----
//Retrieve nearby nodes with the same network id
action [nodeId] status get_nearby
----

Information about all connections with a lot of detail can be requested with the _get_connections_verbose_ command. In scenarios with limited queue sizes, only single connections can be requested via an optional index parameter, as returned by the GetConnections method of the ConnectionManager.

[source,C++]
----
//Retrieve detailed connection information from the node with nodeId.
action [nodeId] status get_connections_verbose

//Same, but only for the connection with the given index.
action [nodeId] status get_connections_verbose {index}
----

[#LiveReports]
=== Live Reports
Live reports are a way to send information about errors, connections, disconnections and other important events to the user through the mesh. Each live report has a unique ID according to its importance. Liver reports are activated by setting the _livereports_ level to a value greater than 0. The different levels are:

* Off (0)
* Error (50)
* Warn (100)
* Info (150)
* Debug (200)

Live reports can be generated in the firmware using the `SendLiveReport` method. Two extra parameters can be given that can contain additional information for the specific report/error. The meaning of the extras is documented at the LiveReportType definition. LiveReports will of course only be received if the node is currently part of the mesh. If this is not the case, than it might be better to use the xref:#ErrorLog[error log].

[source,C++]
----
//Set the livereport level
action [nodeId] status livereports [liveReportLevel]

//Activate livereports for all errors on all nodes
action 0 status livereports 50
----

Live reports are printed on the terminal of a sink node and can be used to debug a problem in a running system:

[source,Javascript]
----
{"type":"live_report","nodeId":123,"module":3,"code":1,"extra":2,"extra2":3}
----

[#ErrorLog]
=== Error Log
The error log stores metrics and errors that help monitoring the mesh. This information can be periodically queried e.g. by a gateway. More information is available on the dedicated xref:ErrorLog.adoc[error log page].

`action [nodeId] status get_errors`

The queried nodes will respond with their complete error log that they have stored in RAM. The error log is cleared on reboot as it is only stored in RAM and is also cleared after it was queried. The error log is printed on a sink node (or any other if json logging is active) as multiple json objects.

{"type":"error_log_entry","nodeId":2,"module":3,"errType":2,"code":20,"extra":6,"time":10030,"typeStr":"CUSTOM","codeStr":"INFO_ERRORS_REQUESTED"}
----

=== Component periodic timestamp sending
The StatusReporterModule includes functionality for periodically sending the nodes current timestamp. 
It has temporary and persistent time reporting functionality.

Temporary time reporting can be enabled and disabled via component_act. When enabled, it is automatically disabled after a few minutes to avoid unnecessary battery usage.

[source,C++]
----
//Enables Periodic sending
component_act [nodeId] 3 2 0xABCD 0x1234 01 [requestHandle]

//Disabled Periodic sending
component_act [nodeId] 3 2 0xABCD 0x1234 00 [requestHandle]
----

Persistent time reporting is enabled with the terminal command:

```Terminal
action [nodeId] status set_time_reporting [intervalDs]
```

_intervalDs_ .. Time reporting interval in deci seconds.
An interval of `0` means no time reporting.

The immediate confirmation message should look like this:
```json
{"type":"time_reporting_state","intervalDs":10,"nodeId":2,"module":3,"code":0}
```

Upon activation, the time is reported with multiple component_sense messages that roughly look like this example:

[source,Javascript]
----
{"nodeId":33011,"type":"component_sense","module":3,"requestHandle":13,"actionType":0,"component":43981,"register":4660,"payload":"AgAAAA=="}
----

The payload of the answer is the base 64 timestamp of the target node.

[#UsbGwStatus]
=== Gateway status for Sink Nodes with USB support
For nodes that use the `ACTIVATE_ONLY_SINK_FUNCTIONALITY` and the `ACTIVATE_VIRTUAL_COM_PORT` defines, the current USB serial Terminal and Gateway status can be retreived and updated.

This value is stored as a `u8` in RAM only. It is updated

* always when calling `set_gw_status`
* when calling `get_gw_status` to ensure that an up to date serial status is provided
** When USB is not initialized, it is set to `USB_PORT_NOT_CONNECTED(2)`
** When USB is initialized and wasn't before, it is set to `USB_PORT_CONNECTED(1)`

==== Set Gateway status
The gateway status can be set to any number from 10 to 255. However, only the following values are defined as an enum:

[#SetGatewayStatusEnum]
===== Enum
```cpp
enum class GatewayStatus : u8 {
    // 0..9 from firmware side
    UNKNOWN = 0,
    USB_PORT_CONNECTED = 1,
    USB_PORT_NOT_CONNECTED = 2, // overwrites the other states
    // 10.. set from outside, overwrites USB_PORT_CONNECTED
    READY = 10, //Serial communication handshake done
    USB_PORT_CONNECTED_BUT_UNKNOWN_STATUS = 11, // when the gateway failed to determine current state
    READY_BUT_NO_BLUERANGE_CONNECTION = 12, // no server connection
    READY_BUT_NOT_ENROLLED = 13,
    READY_BUT_NO_MESH_CONNECTION = 14, // enrolled but no other node is enrolled
};
```

The response is the current Gateway status:

```Terminal
action [nodeId] status set_gw_status [status]

// Example
action this status set_gw_status 10
// Example response
{"type":"gw_status","nodeId":2,"module":3,"status":10}
```

==== Get Gateway status
As noted xref:#UsbGwStatus[in the introduction], the Gateway status can be updated by the node when calling `get_gw_status`.

```Terminal
action [nodeId] status get_gw_status

// Example
action this status get_gw_status
// Example response: node just started -> UNKNOWN
{"type":"gw_status","nodeId":2,"module":3,"status":0}

// ... USB plugged in
action this status get_gw_status
{"type":"gw_status","nodeId":2,"module":3,"status":1}

// ... Gateway sets the status
action this status set_gw_status
{"type":"gw_status","nodeId":2,"module":3,"status":10}

// ... USB unplugged
action this status get_gw_status
{"type":"gw_status","nodeId":2,"module":3,"status":2}
```

=== Live Reports
The _statusReporterModule_ can send live reports that
notify the user over various state changes and error conditions. A live
report is generated for a node and then broadcast over the mesh.
This allows live debugging of mesh errors, e.g. if two nodes
are not connecting to each other. Live reports are also received over
_MeshAccessConnection_, which means an error can be detected after connecting
to the disconnected part of the mesh using a _MeshAccessConnection_.
