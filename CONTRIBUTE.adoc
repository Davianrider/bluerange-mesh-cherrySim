== Documentation
The documentation is done in link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[Asciidoc] and available under the doc/ folder in the repository. A number of conventions should be followed when documenting.

All TerminalCommands should be documented with their expected input and output. The inputParameters that can be changed by the user should be given in square brackets `[param]`. Optional parameters should be given in curly brackes `{opt_param = 0}` with a default value. A Template documentation file is available here: <<DocumentationTemplate.adoc#,DocumentationTemplate>>.
